The Matlab file "concatenate_and_save.m" has the following functionality:
    1. Reads all .wav files per subject
    2. Performs spike removal on all PCG channels
    3. Concatenates channel wise
    4 Saves concatenated files into a new directory - 1 .wav file per subject

    It calls the function "schmidt_spike_removal"


The Matlabe file "join_dia_sit_noiseInd.m" has the following functionality:
    1. Reads all. wav files per subject
    2. For each PCG channel:
        - Does spike removal
        - calls the function "segment_signal_noise_multi_MedPow.m" (for the PCG signal and noise mic)
        - joins the "bad indicies from PCG and noise mic
        - converts them to a list of "good indicies". This includes first and last 1.5 seconds of each file, so that concatenated areas are never included in downstream tasks
        - saves each subject and corresponding good indicies in a channel-specific csv file

    It calls the function "schmidt_spike_removal" and "segment_signal_noise_multi_MedPow.m"

    NOTE - concatenated files are no longer saved here
